title: Comparing React Hooks with Vue Composition API
summary: What are their similarities and differences?
---
React presents [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) as an alternative to [classes extending React.Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) for writing components. They have received an overwhelming positive reaction from the community, since for a long time there has been a steep learning curve for adopting classes and situations like starting a new component as a stateless function and realizing later we need state and having to refactor the whole component as a `class`.

Vue recently presented the [Vue Composition API RFC](https://vue-composition-api-rfc.netlify.com), a new API for writing Vue components inspired by React Hooks but with many interesting differences that I will discuss in this post. This RFC has a really controversial story, since it started with [a previous version called Functio-based Component API](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/function-apis/active-rfcs/0000-function-api.md) that received [lots of criticism](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/42) from certain part of the community, based on the fear of Vue starting to be more complicated and less like the simple library that people liked in the first place.

The Vue core team made a great emphasis on assuring the community that this new API won't make the original API (now informally referred as the "Options-based API") disappear, and we will be even be able to [combine both components API](https://vue-composition-api-rfc.netlify.com/#usage-alongside-existing-api) together.

React hooks allow you to "hook into" React functionalities like the component state and side effects handling. You make use of hooks inside function components so each time the component renders, the hooks are evaluated. This is one of the first differences we can identify between React Hooks and Vue Composition API, **React hooks run each time the component renders while Vue setup function is only executed once**. Because React Hooks can get executed multiple times, there are [certain rules](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) the render function must follow, one of them being:

> Donâ€™t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. 

Here is a code example straight from React docs that demonstrate this:
```js{6-10}
function Form() {
  // 1. Use the name state variable
  const [name, setName] = useState('Mary');

  // 2. Use an effect for persisting the form
  if (name !== '') {
    useEffect(function persistForm() {
      localStorage.setItem('formData', name);
    });
  }
  // 3. Use the surname state variable
  const [surname, setSurname] = useState('Poppins');

  // 4. Use an effect for updating the title
  useEffect(function updateTitle() {
    document.title = name + ' ' + surname;
  });

  // ...
}
```

React interally keeps track of all the hooks we are using in our component. In this example we are using four hooks. But notice how the first `useEffect` invocation is done conditionally, and since on the first render the `name` state variable will be assigned the default value of `'Mary'`, React will know that it needs to keep track of all of these four hooks in order. What happens if on another render the `name` state is empty? Well, if that's the case React won't know what to return on the second `useState` hook call. To avoid this and other issues, there is an [ESLint plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) that is strongly recommended when working with React Hooks and is included by default with Create React App.

Going back to Vue, something equivalent to the previous example would be this:
```js
export default {
  setup() {
    // 1. Use the name state variable
    const name = ref("Mary");
    // 2. Use a watcher for persisting the form
    if(name.value !== '') {
      watch(function persistForm() => {
        localStorage.setItem('formData', name.value);
      });
    }
   // 3. Use the surname state variable
   const surname = ref("Poppins");
   // 4. Use a watcher for updating the title
   watch(function updateTitle() {
     document.title = name.value + ' ' + surname.value;
   });
  }
}
```

Since the `setup` method will only run once, we can make use of the different functions that are part of the Composition API (`reactive`, `ref`, `computed`, `watch`, lifecycle hooks, etc.) as part of loops or conditional statements. However, for this same reason, the `if` statement will also only run once, so it  will only make sense if we include it inside of the `watch` callback:
```js
watch(function persistForm() => {
  if(name.value !== '') {
    localStorage.setItem('formData', name.value);
  }
});
